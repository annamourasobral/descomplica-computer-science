Save the file with the ".java" extension

To compile a Java program:
`javac FileName.java`

A fileName.class will be generated

To run a .class file:
`java FileName`

Once the Java program has been compiled, a .class file is generated. The file name will be "class name.class"

For inputting data into a Java program via the Command Prompt, the input[] array is an argument passed as a parameter to void main.
